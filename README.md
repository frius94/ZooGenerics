# ZooGenerics
A simple java program to learn the usage of:
* abstract classes
* interfaces
* inheritance

The program has no UI so you need to play it on the console.
## Usage
Just clone the repository and use the files in the src folder. You need to compile and run the main.java file to start the program.
## Features
You are in a zoo and can do the following things:
* visit various animals
* pet animals
* feed animals
## Java version
I recommend at least java version 8 and upwards.
